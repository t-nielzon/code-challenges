/*
Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing
the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next.

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting
input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

[1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]

But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature?

[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]

You need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list,
returns the first n elements - signature included - of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number;
if n == 0, then return an empty array and be ready for anything else which is
not clearly specified ;)
