/*
1, 246, 2, 123, 3, 82, 6, 41 are the divisors of number 246.

Squaring these divisors we get: 1, 60516, 4, 15129, 9, 6724, 36, 1681.

The sum of these squares is 84100 which is 290 * 290.

Task:
Find all integers between m and n (m and n are integers with 1 <= m <= n)
such that the sum of their squared divisors is itself a square.

Return an array of subarrays with two elements: first the number whose
squared divisors sum to a perfect square, then that sum.

Example:
  m =  1, n = 250 --> [[1, 1], [42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
  m = 42, n = 250 --> [[42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
