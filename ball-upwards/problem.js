/**
 * Ball Upwards (6 kyu)
 * 
 * You throw a ball vertically upwards with an initial speed v0 (in km per hour).
 * 
 * The height h of the ball at each time t is given by:
 * h = v0 * t - 0.5 * g * t * t
 * where g is the Earth's gravity (g ≈ 9.81 m/s²).
 * 
 * A device is recording at every tenth of second the height of the ball.
 * 
 * For example, with v0 = 15 km/h:
 * (0, 0.0), (1, 0.367...), (2, 0.637...), (3, 0.808...), (4, 0.881...)
 * where the first number is the time in tenths of a second and the second is height in meters.
 * 
 * Task:
 * Write a function with a parameter v0 (in km per hour) that returns the time in tenth of second
 * of the maximum height recorded by the device.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * Given initial speed v0 = 15 --> should return 4
 * Given initial speed v0 = 25 --> should return 7
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Remember to convert the velocity from km/h to m/s or from m/s to km/h when necessary.
 * - The maximum height recorded by the device is not necessarily the maximum height reached by the ball.
