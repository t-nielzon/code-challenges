/*
 * Coding with Squared Strings
 * Difficulty: 5 kyu
 *
 * A squared string has n lines, each substring being n characters long.
 * Example: s = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop" is a squared string of size 4.
 *
 * We will use squared strings to code and decode texts. To make things easier
 * we suppose that our original text doesn't include the character '\n'.
 *
 * Coding:
 *   Input: a text t of length l.
 *   - Consider the smallest integer n such that n * n >= l.
 *   - Complete t with the char of ascii code 11 (we suppose that this char is
 *     not in our original text) until the length of t is n * n.
 *   - Transform the new t in a squared string s of size n by inserting '\n'
 *     where needed.
 *   - Apply a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees to s.
 *
 * Decoding:
 *   Input: a squared string s resulting from the coding.
 *   - Apply a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees to s.
 *   - Do some cleaning to have the original text t.
 *
 * Example:
 *   t = "I.was.going.fishing.that.morning.at.ten.o'clock"
 *   code(t) -> "c.nhsoI\nltiahi.\noentinw\ncng.nga\nk..mg.s\n\voao.f.\n\v'trtig"
 *   decode(code(t)) == "I.was.going.fishing.that.morning.at.ten.o'clock"
