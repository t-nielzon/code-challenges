/*
 * In this kata, you will be given a string of text and valid parentheses, such as "h(el)lo".
 *
 * You must return the string, with only the text inside parentheses reversed, so "h(el)lo"
 * becomes "h(le)lo". However, if said parenthesized text contains parenthesized text itself,
 * then that too must reversed back, so it faces the original direction. When parentheses are
 * reversed, they should switch directions, so they remain syntactically correct
 * (i.e. "h((el)l)o" becomes "h(l(el))o").
 *
 * This pattern should repeat for however many layers of parentheses. There may be multiple
 * groups of parentheses at any level (i.e. "(1) (2 (3) (4))"), so be sure to account for these.
 *
 * Input parentheses will always be valid (e.g.. you will never get "(()" or ")"). String
 * without any parentheses are possible and should be returned as-is.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   "h(el)lo"                      ==> "h(le)lo"
 *   "a ((d e) c b)"                ==> "a (b c (d e))"
 *   "one (two (three) four)"       ==> "one (ruof (three) owt)"
 *   "one (ruof ((rht)ee) owt)"     ==> "one (two ((thr)ee) four)"
 *   "no parentheses"               ==> "no parentheses"
