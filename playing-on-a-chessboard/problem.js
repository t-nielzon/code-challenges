/*
 * With a friend we used to play the following game on a chessboard (8 rows, 8 columns).
 * On the first row at the bottom we put numbers:
 *   1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8, 8/9
 * On row 2:
 *   1/3, 2/4, 3/5, 4/6, 5/7, 6/8, 7/9, 8/10
 * On row 3:
 *   1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/7, 5/8, 6/9, 7/10, 8/11
 * ...until the last row:
 *   1/9, 2/10, 3/11, 4/12, 5/13, 6/14, 7/15, 8/16
 *
 * When all numbers are on the chessboard each in turn we toss a coin. The one who
 * gets "head" wins and the other gives him, in dollars, the sum of the numbers on
 * the chessboard.
 *
 * Task: How much can I (or my friend) win or lose for each game if the chessboard
 * has n rows and n columns? Add all of the fractional values on an n by n sized
 * board and give the answer as a simplified fraction.
 *
 * The function `game` takes parameter n (integer >= 0) and returns the result as
 * an irreducible fraction written as an array of integers: [numerator, denominator].
 * If the denominator is 1 return [numerator].
