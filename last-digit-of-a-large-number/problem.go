/*
Define a function that takes in two non-negative integers a and b
and returns the last decimal digit of a^b. Note that a and b may
be very large!

For example, the last decimal digit of 9^7 is 9, since 9^7 = 4782969.
The last decimal digit of (2^200)^(2^300), which has over 10^92 decimal
digits, is 6. Also, please take 0^0 to be 1.

You may assume that the input will always be valid.
