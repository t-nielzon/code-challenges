/*
In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually with two
or more unknowns, such that only the integer solutions are sought or studied.

In this kata we want to find all integers x, y (x >= 0, y >= 0) solutions of a
diophantine equation of the form:

    x² - 4y² = n

(where the unknowns are x and y; and n is a given positive number)
in decreasing order of the positive x_i.

If there is no solution return [] or "[]" or "".

Examples:
    90005 --> [[45003, 22501], [9003, 4499], [981, 467], [309, 37]]
    90002 --> []

Hint:
    x² - 4y² = (x - 2y) · (x + 2y)
