/*
 * I Promise Not To Optimize
 *
 * This kata can be considered a follow-up to "Make Me Slow".
 * ___
 * In order to maximize slacking on the job, lately you have been adding
 * useless and slow code to every function in the company's codebase,
 * delaying the function's return by as much as possible:
 *
 *     function getUserName(userID) {
 *         // let's slow things down a bit:
 *         for (let i = 0; i < 1_000_000_000; i++)
 *             ; // do nothing 😈
 *         return USERS.find(user => user.id === userID).name;
 *     }
 *
 * Your evil plot kicks into gear, and you deploy anti-optimized code
 * everywhere in your production server. But the higher-ups are catching
 * on! -- they demand that functions return their result as quickly as
 * possible, or else you risk being fired.
 *
 * You wallow in despair, unable to bring your dream of inefficiency to
 * reality, but finally realize there's a way you can keep everything
 * woefully inneficient, while still immediately returning values from
 * functions -- Promises!
 *
 * So now your task is to write the function `antiOptimizeAsync`, which
 * takes a single parameter `task` (a function), and immediately returns
 * a `Promise` that only resolves to the return value of `task()` at least
 * 11 seconds (and at most 12 seconds) after `antiOptimizeAsync` is called.
 *
 * `task` will always be an arbitrary function that might run for any
 * duration between 0 to 10 seconds.
