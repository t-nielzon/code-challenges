/*
A natural number is called k-prime if it has exactly k prime factors, counted with multiplicity.

Examples:
k = 2  -->  4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, ...
k = 3  -->  8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, ...
k = 5  -->  32, 48, 72, 80, 108, 112, ...

Task 1:
Complete the function countKprimes which is given parameters k, start, end
and returns an array of the k-primes between start (inclusive) and end (inclusive).
For Go: nil slice is expected when there are no k-primes between start and end.

Example: countKprimes(5, 500, 600) --> [500, 520, 552, 567, 588, 592, 594]

Task 2:
Given a positive integer s, find the total number of solutions of the equation
a + b + c = s, where a is 1-prime, b is 3-prime, and c is 7-prime.

Examples:
puzzle(138)  -->  1  because [2 + 8 + 128] is the only solution
puzzle(143)  -->  2  because [3 + 12 + 128] and [7 + 8 + 128] are the solutions
