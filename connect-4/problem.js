/*
 * Connect 4
 *
 * The game consists of a grid (7 columns and 6 rows) and two players
 * that take turns to drop their discs. The pieces fall straight down,
 * occupying the next available space within the column. The objective
 * of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or
 * diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
 *
 * Create a Class called Connect4 that has a method called play which
 * takes one argument for the column where the player is going to place
 * their disc.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - If a player successfully has 4 discs horizontally, vertically or
 *   diagonally then return "Player n wins!" where n is the current
 *   player either 1 or 2.
 * - If a player attempts to place a disc in a column that is full then
 *   return "Column full!" and the next move must be taken by the same
 *   player.
 * - If the game has been won by a player, any following moves should
 *   return "Game has finished!".
 * - Any other move should return "Player n has a turn" where n is the
 *   current player either 1 or 2.
 * - Player 1 starts the game every time and alternates with player 2.
 * - The columns are numbered 0-6 left to right.
