/*
 * Lazy Chain
 * Difficulty: 5 kyu
 *
 * Method chaining is a useful technique in JavaScript, allowing better
 * composability and readability of functions.
 *
 * One problem with standard JavaScript chaining is that chained methods are
 * immediately executed upon creation.
 *
 *   let a = [1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2).reverse();
 *   // a = [6, 4, 2]
 *
 * The problem with this is that it opens values up to possible mutation before
 * being called.
 *
 *   a = a.join("");      // a = "642"
 *   doSomething(a);      // TypeError - a is not an array
 *
 * To combat this we can create a function `lazyChain` that accepts an argument
 * and allows chaining, but delays execution to when the value method is called.
 *
 *   let a = lazyChain([1,2,3])
 *                     .invoke('map', x => x * 2)
 *                     .invoke('reverse');
 *
 *   console.log(a.value());   // [6, 4, 2]
 *   a.join("");               // TypeError
 *   doSomething(a.value());   // valid function call
 *
 * Your task is to create the function `lazyChain` which accepts any value, and
 * allows method chaining through the use of invoke, and execution with the
 * value method.
 *
 * Keep in mind that invoke is general enough to accept any prototype methods
 * from the standard language.
